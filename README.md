# Statistics-Program
I attempt to create a Java program that recreates a statistics calculator's functionality. In this README file, I am also including a Version Log for my reference as well as anyone else's reference. Feel free to create issues/report bugs (and I will manually change this log)

Version 1.0 Functionality Summary:
- This version currently runs in Command Prompt and has 2 options combined into one (entering a data set and calculating mean and median with the values entered)
- The user can enter as many values as they want until they type in "DONE."
- I currently used a lot of ArrayLists to seperate the data sets (so it is currently very inefficient)

Version 1.1 Functionality Summary:
- Version 1.1 still runs in Command Prompt
- Main is still being refactored
- More efficient with GET/SET methods instead of ArrayLists
